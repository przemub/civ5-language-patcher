## Civilization V language patcher

Have you been shafted by Aspyr supporting only five languages in macOS and Linux versions of Civilization V? Is Civilization VI not your game? I have your back.

`patch.sh` script copies language files from Windows version to macOS/Linux version.

It is user-unfriendly and runs from console. Usage: `patch.sh [Mac/Linux Civ V application] [Windows Civ V directory] [Language code] [Language name]`. Leave out language code and name for Polish. For i.e. German, input "DE_DE" "German".

Tested only with Polish, macOS 11.3, Civ V Steam version. Tell me if it somehow worked in other conditions.

Going back for one more turn now.
